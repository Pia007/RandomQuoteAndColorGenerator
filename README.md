## Overview

### The Project

[![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/Pia007/RandomQuoteAndColorGenerator.svg)](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/Pia007/RandomQuoteAndColorGenerator)

Random Quote & Background Color Generator

This is a Random Quote Generator with the added feature of generating a background color and applying that color to other elements.  The quotes were fetched from the [Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/). The page loads with a random color theme and on each button click a new quote and its author is genrated and the font and buttons display the same random color.  The hexidecimal colors are randomly generated with over 16 million possible combinations.

### What I learned

I worked primarily with Javascript which is an ongoing learning process.  Accessing and fetching data from an API is an area of opportunity to engage in an aspect of coding that I had not attempted before.  I am looking forward to continuing this journey.

### Continued development

This project will continued to be developed with other libraries and frameworks.
